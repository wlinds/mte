    "This game is inspired by Hearthstone and is like, a two-player (or two-computer) game in which each player draws card units from a set, places them on their side of the board and then let the units fight each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each battle, the ammount of units left on each side translates to the total damage dealt to the opposing player. When a player reaches 0 HP, the game is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have multiple matrices (overlaying boards) for attack value and defense values for each unit, not just health.\n",
    "    - Or just have vectors in the matrice containing stats for the unit??\n",
    "    - if we do this, another layout would be needed, as the current layout only handles one value for each unit\n",
    "    - but it would be cool to do and make it much more interesting and l√§rorikt i guess\n",
    "\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have units which buffs other units if they are placed next to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have units merge if they are similar in some way??\n",
    "    - This also means having to create different unit-types, which would be fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have units move to different spaces. This is an intersting one. Maybe attack could increase if some units are closer?\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO:\n",
    "\n",
    "How should the units be distributed between the players? How should it be randomized? Just draw a couple from a deck probably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjust attack patterns. Right now its simply just row subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this is written to work with jupyter notebook, some adjustments needed for .py to avoid re-running functions etc."
